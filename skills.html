            <li>Craddle</li>
            <p>Craddling is essential because it is how the ball stays in your stick.You are going to put your dominant hand a little less than 3/4 way up your stick and your non dominant hand on the bottom of the shaft.You are going to want to move your dominant wrist in a door hinge motion.In and out while keeping your bottom hand a bit loose but sturdy. Now add a ball in the deep part of your sticks's pocket and do the door hinge motion.You now know how to craddle. </p>
            <li>Passing</li>
            <p>When passing remember to push and pull.Place the head of the stick near yours and use your top hand and arm to push your stick while also pulling it towards your body. You should be rotating your hips and shoulders as well. Focus on the follow through because it determines where your pass will land. </p>
            <li>Shooting</li>
            <p>First choose a corner for your shot. You should raise your stick behind your head and bend your dominant arm at around a 90 degree angle.Make sure that you turn your torso when you shoot. Move your stick across your body as you follow through on your shot.</p>
            <li>Groundballs</li>
            <p>Bend down as low as you can to get the ball and cover your stick. Place your stick at a slight angle that allows you to scoop the ball. You should be running through this motion. You want to be fast and accurate when getting the ball before an opponent does.</p>
